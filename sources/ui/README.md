# UI (User Interface).
The main approach is to use [React JS](https://reactjs.org) to create the UI. It's planned to use [Tauri JS](https://tauri.app) to make a native desktop app if needed.

Using [Bun](https://bun.sh) as package manager. [NPM](https://npmjs.org) and [Pnpm](https://pnpmjs.io) can also be used for the project.

## Run
To run the module, open a terminal into the module folder and run:
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you, as me, like to use bun, you can simply run:
```shell
bun install
bun dev
```
