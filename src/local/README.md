# Local server (local).
The local server collects the data of all the meters and devices (IEDs).
It needs to be efficient managing all the signals (IO).

## Run
To run this module, open a terminal in the folder and run:
```shell
npm install
npm install -g tsx
tsx watch index.ts
```
If you, as me, prefer bun, just run:
```shell
bun install
bun --watch index.ts
```
